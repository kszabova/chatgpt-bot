This repository contains a demo of a customer support chatbot based on ChatGPT.

# Installation

The chatbot requires Python >= 3.10 (lower versions will probably work too).

It also requires the `openai` module to run.

```
pip install openai
```

The application is intended for command-line use. Download the entire repository to an arbitrary location.

# Usage

To start the chatbot, navigate to its root directory and run

```
python -m src.main
```

Type your messages in the command line window or type 'stop' to stop the chatbot.
